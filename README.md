# AOC2021
my solutions to the Advent Of Code in 2021!

I'll try to upload an answer every day, but I'm not going to sweat the coding time and I'll try to keep the performance acceptable.

Everything is made in python version 3.10.0.

# Opinion on Solutions
day 1: I really like the code I made, and the challanges were nice and easy.

day 2: Your avarage 'just loop through the input and see', nothing special here.

day 3: pain. I think my challange 1 solution is pretty optimised, if you can call rotating an array optimised that is. challange 2 took me hours to complete though, but I did 
succeed even without having to look at any solutions!

day 4: Way bigger file size than i wanted it to be, and it has 4 nested loops so if you're looking for a fast day 4 solution look somewhere else.

day 5: I feel like there is a way to find all the points without simulating the whole board, but if there is one i haven't found it, I also dislike the hardcoded size of 1000x1000 for the grid, but I don't have the time or energy to make better code today.

day 6: This challange was kind of easy but very fun to do! in part 1 I tried to get a solution in as little lines as possible, in which I think I suceeded, but in part 2 I can't just use the same code as it took lonfer than a minute and I did not feel like waiting, so I just used a whole lot of varible assignment, which is a million times faster but it's a lot of repeating code.

day 7: My solution here is pretty optimised, eventhough it takes a second or two to run, I can't think of a faster way to do it, if you're wandering what I did in part two, look up triangle numbers.

day 8: part 1 was an easy one-liner but part 2 took me hours to complete, I still despise the linecount even after I shorted it by 50%.
