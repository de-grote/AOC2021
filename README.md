# AOC2021
my solutions to the Advent Of Code in 2021!

I'll try to upload an answer every day, but I'm not going to sweat the coding time and I'll try to keep the performance acceptable.

Everything is made in python version 3.10.0.

# Opinion on Solutions
day 1: I really like the code I made, and the challanges were nice and easy.

day 2: Your avarage 'just loop through the input and see', nothing special here.

day 3: pain. I think my challange 1 solution is pretty optimised, if you can call rotating an array optimised that is. challange 2 took me hours to complete though, but I did 
succeed even without having to look at any solutions!

day 4: Way bigger file size than i wanted it to be, and it has 4 nested loops so if you're looking for a fast day 4 solution look somewhere else.

day 5: I feel like there is a way to find all the points without simulating the whole board, but if there is one i haven't found it, I also dislike the hardcoded size of 1000x1000 for the grid, but I don't have the time or energy to make better code today.
